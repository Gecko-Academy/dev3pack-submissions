"""What a course page is, and how it renders.

The pages are MDX carrying `<Question>` blocks -- the Hugging Face course
format. Nothing that merely reads the file renders that: GitHub's preview shows
the headings and then prints `<Question choices={[{ text: ...` as a paragraph,
on Hugging Face's own repository as much as on ours. The `explain` strings are
the teaching, and they are exactly what is lost.

So a page is parsed here, in the package, and the three surfaces that show one
are transport:

  * `bootcamp_agent.read.page("session-01/quiz")` -- inline in Jupyter, which is
    where a learner already is, beside the exercise the page is about.
  * `scripts/course_html.py` -- the whole course as a static site.
  * anything later, including a hosted site, because the parse is here.

WHY THE QUIZ IS `<details>` AND NOT JAVASCRIPT. `display(HTML(...))` inserts
through `innerHTML`, and a `<script>` inserted that way never executes -- in any
browser, not as a Jupyter policy. A quiz built on a click handler is therefore
dead inside a notebook. `<details>` needs no script at all, so one rendering
works in Jupyter, in the site with JavaScript off, and in GitHub's own markdown.
The site layers a little JavaScript on top for polish; nothing depends on it.
