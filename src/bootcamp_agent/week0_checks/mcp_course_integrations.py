"""Checkers for Course B, unit 11: a database, an API, and somebody else's server.

Two of the three exercises hand over the path to a server file, and the checks
read it twice. First with `ast`, because the two mistakes this unit exists to
prevent are both invisible at runtime on a well-behaved input: an f-string
query answers correctly right up to the day somebody sends a quote, and a key
in a tool's parameter list works perfectly while leaking the credential to
every client. Then over the wire, with the same `probe` unit 9 uses, because a
server that parses is not a server that answers.

The third exercise is prose, and it is checked as prose: the placeholders have
to be gone, the sentences have to be sentences, and the surface-area answer has
to carry the number it claims to be about.

NOTHING HERE GOES ON THE NETWORK. The hosted surface is a recorded tool list in
`fixtures/orquestra-tools.json`, read from disk. Session 13 connects to the real
one.
