"""Checkers for Course B, units 9 and 10: an MCP server, its client, and the loop around an LLM.

The learner writes a real server file and the checker talks to it the way any
MCP client would: it starts the file as a child process over stdio, asks it one
thing, and ends the whole process tree. Nothing here reads the learner's answer
off the page when it can ask the server instead. The one exception is the
server file itself, which is parsed with `ast` for the two things a client
cannot see at runtime: whether the type hints and the docstring are there.

THE PROCESS RULE. A probe is a child interpreter in its own session, with a
deadline. When the deadline passes the session is killed, server included,
because a learner's server that never answers must not outlive the check. A
server that answers is gone the moment the probe's `async with` blocks close:
stdio servers die when their client closes the pipe.
