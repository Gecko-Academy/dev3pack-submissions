"""LangChain template #2 — API operation -> semantic intent (optional pre-work).

The app: given the name of an API operation (e.g. "GET /pets/{petId}"),
generate a semantic description of its intent — what it does, what it
returns, when an agent should use it, and which operations it DEPENDS on
(before/after). The dependencies section is the graph-engineering hook: each
"call X first to obtain petId" line is an edge, and collecting those edges
across an API is exactly how a correlation graph gets built (see
cookbook/integrations/11_autonomous_petshop.py for the deterministic version).

Compare your output with cookbook/introduction/02_comprehend_an_openapi.ipynb,
which does the same job from a real spec — and notice what the full spec knows
that the bare operation name cannot.

Setup (optional material — not part of the course dependencies):
    uv add langchain langchain-openai
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...     # or put it in .env

Run:
    uv run python units/en/session-04-bounded-tools/langchain_api_intent.py
