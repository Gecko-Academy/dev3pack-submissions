"""LangChain template — explain a concept (optional Session 5 pre-work).

LangChain's `init_chat_model` is the framework's version of the provider seam
you built in `bootcamp_agent/llm.py`: one line picks the provider, and the
rest of the code never knows which model it got.

Setup (not part of the course dependencies — this is optional material):
    uv add langchain langchain-openai
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...     # or put it in .env

Run:
    uv run python units/en/session-04-bounded-tools/langchain_template.py

Without a key (or without langchain installed) the script explains what it
would do and exits cleanly — the same graceful-skip convention as the course
notebooks.
